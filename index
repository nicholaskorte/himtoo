        Men Are Assaulted Too.
    </div>
    <!--The fact written below is complete bullshit btw. Im just making fun of the stupid things me too says-->

        Roughly 16% of all sexual assault cases reported in 2016 were filed by men.

        Our Vision
    </div>
    <div id="p1"><p>The 'him too.' movement was founded in 2018 to help male survivors of sexual violence,<span id="middle"> particularly straight white cisgender males from white wealthy communities</span>, find pathways to healing. Our vision from the beginning was to address both the scarcity in resources for male survivors of sexual violence and to build a community of people who care about male rights, driven by survivors, who will be at the front line for creating solutions to stop sexual violence against men in their communities. </p>
<p>Within 1 week I built this entire website to make fun of the me too. movement because they think that all sexual violence victims are female and that even without evidence a man can be proven guilty. I created this website to show the humor in saying things that are obviously not true and I hope one day this website will bring in some serious traffic to get my cause out into the public.</p>
<p>Our goal is also to reframe and expand the global conversation around sexual violence to also support the fact that men are also sexually violated. Our target demographic is middle aged white males who are cisgender and straight. We want perpetrators that are actually proven guilty to be held accountable and we want to actually do something about the assaults that are happening to our demographic.</p></div>

<p>In 2018, someone founded the<span class="highlight"> him too.</span> movement to help male survivors of sexual violence find pathways to healing. Using the idea of "innocent until proven guilty," the<span class="highlight"> him too.</span> movement was ultimately created to maek sure survivors aware that they're not alone in their path to redemption.</p><p>The<span class="highlight"> him too.</span> movement was built by a community of people who thought the me too movement sucked. By bringing up conversations about sexual violence against men into the mainstream media, we're helping to show that men can be sexually violated too and to show that innocent until proven guilty is only fair for the alleged assaulters. Ultimately, with men at the forefront of this movement, we're aiding the fight to end sexual violence against men.</p>
